# odin-recipes
My current project is to build a basic recipes website. It will consist of a main recipes page which will have links to a few other pages. 

By the end of this, I should have been able to demonstarte these skills: 
-creating an index.html homepage
-adding text with heading, paragraphs, bold and italiscised words.
-creating other webpages within my website 
-adding links to the homapage that will allow me to naviagte to other webpages 


Reflection: 
-I am more confident with using the command line to add projects and git and push them to github
-I have a better understanding of when to commit and the comments to write when doing so 
-I am more confident with linking images and links
